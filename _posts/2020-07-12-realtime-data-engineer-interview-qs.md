> When interviewing for a (senior) data engineering position, expect to perhaps see these 
kind of questions. Even if you don't get asked these questions, these are good to know.

> Of course, if you don't know answers in an interview, it is a lot of the time not a problem.  
Big Data is a broad field so just answer as best you can and explain 
your area's of expertise in as much detail as you can.
