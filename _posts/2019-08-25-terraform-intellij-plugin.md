#### Problem:
-  Make terraform scripting easier with autocomplete and syntax highlighting.

#### Solution:
- The Intellij Terraform Plugin has auto-complete and many more features outlined below.

Basically this plugin is excellent for auto-completion, if you are not using it for terraform already do so now!
  

###Features:
##### For file formats using HCL (.hcl, .tf, .nomad):
* Syntax highlighting
* Structure outline in the 'Structure' tool window
* Code formatter with the 'Reformat code' action available
* Code folding
* The 'Comment/Uncomment' action
* For HIL files:
* Syntax highlighting
* Terraform specific support:

* In both configuration files and interpolations:
* Autocompletion
* Find Usages / Go to definition for resources, providers, variables and their properties
* Rename Refactoring
* Introduce Variable Refactoring (for string property values)
* Several inspections
* Report usage of deprecated properties
* Unresolved reference checks (in interpolations)
* Check required/missing properties in resource/provider
* Predefined Terraform methods autocompletion in interpolations
* (WIP) Better properties validation (type checking)
* (WIP) Working with dependent modules
* (WIP) Type-specific autocompletion in interpolations
